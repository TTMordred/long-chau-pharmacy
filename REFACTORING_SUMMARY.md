# ‚úÖ Architectural Refactoring Complete

## üéØ Mission Accomplished

The React/TypeScript pharmacy application has been successfully refactored to implement the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern and Repository pattern as required for the university assignment. All four vertical slice features have been implemented with clean architecture principles.

## üìã Completed Tasks Checklist

### ‚úÖ 1. Data Access Layer (Repository Pattern)
- [x] Created repository interfaces in `src/com/longchau/pms/persistence/api/`
  - [x] `IProductRepository.ts`

  - [x] `IOrderRepository.ts`
- [x] Implemented file-based persistence in `src/com/longchau/pms/persistence/file/`
  - [x] `FileBasedProductRepository.ts`
  - [x] `FileBasedPrescriptionRepository.ts`

### ‚úÖ 2. Presentation Layer (MVP Pattern)
- [x] Created Presenter classes in `src/com/longchau/pms/ui/presenter/`
  - [x] `PrescriptionUploadPresenter.ts` - Handles prescription submission logic

  - [x] `PrescriptionUploadFrame.tsx` - Customer prescription upload interface
  - [x] `PrescriptionValidationFrame.tsx` - Pharmacist review dashboard
  - [x] `OrderCreationFrame.tsx` - Order creation from validated prescriptions
  - [x] `InventoryManagementFrame.tsx` - Real-time stock management

### ‚úÖ 3. Vertical Slice Implementation

#### ‚úÖ Task 3: Digital Prescription Submission
- [x] File upload interface with validation (JPG, PNG, PDF, max 10MB)
- [x] Automatic status marking as "Pending Validation"
- [x] User prescription history display
- [x] Error handling and user feedback

#### ‚úÖ Task 5: Pharmacist Prescription Validation  
- [x] Dashboard with filtering (all, pending, approved, rejected)
- [x] Approve/reject functionality with mandatory notes for rejection
- [x] Status update tracking with timestamps
- [x] Prescription image viewing capability

#### ‚úÖ Task 4: Order Placement with Prescription
- [x] Validation that prescriptions are approved before order creation
- [x] Prevention of adding unvalidated prescriptions to orders
- [x] Prescription-required product selection
- [x] Order total calculation and delivery address collection

#### ‚úÖ Task 7: Real-time Inventory Management
- [x] Order completion workflow
- [x] Automatic stock decrementing when orders are completed
- [x] Before/after stock level display demonstration
- [x] Stock change history tracking

### ‚úÖ 4. Project Organization
- [x] Created main package structure `src/com/longchau/pms/`
- [x] Organized files into appropriate sub-packages:
  - [x] `main/` - Main application entry point (`PMSApp.tsx`)
  - [x] `domain/` - Core data model classes (`Product.ts`, `Prescription.ts`, `Order.ts`)
  - [x] `persistence/api/` - Repository interfaces
  - [x] `persistence/file/` - File-based repository implementations
  - [x] `ui/view/` - React components (Views)
  - [x] `ui/presenter/` - Presenter classes
- [x] Updated import paths throughout the application
- [x] Added navigation links to the PMS demo

## üöÄ How to Test the Implementation

### 1. Access the PMS Demo
Navigate to `/pms-demo` in the application to access the refactored MVP architecture demonstration.

### 2. Complete Workflow Test
1. **Upload Prescription** (Task 3):
   - Go to "üì§ Task 3: Upload Prescription" tab
   - Upload a prescription file (any JPG, PNG, or PDF under 10MB)
   - Observe status marked as "Pending Validation"

2. **Validate Prescription** (Task 5):
   - Switch to "‚úÖ Task 5: Validate Prescriptions" tab
   - View the uploaded prescription in pending state
   - Approve it with optional notes
   - Observe status change to "Approved"

3. **Create Order** (Task 4):
   - Go to "üõí Task 4: Create Order" tab
   - Select the validated prescription
   - Add prescription-required products
   - Enter delivery address and create order

4. **Complete Order & Update Inventory** (Task 7):
   - Switch to "üì¶ Task 7: Manage Inventory" tab
   - View current stock levels
   - Complete the created order
   - Observe automatic stock decrement and change history

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Benefits Demonstrated

### MVP Pattern Benefits:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Views handle only UI, Presenters contain business logic
- **Testability**: Business logic is isolated and testable
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between layers

### Repository Pattern Benefits:
- **Data Access Abstraction**: Business logic doesn't depend on storage implementation
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap file-based for database storage
- **Testing**: Can mock repositories for unit testing

### File-Based Persistence:
- **No Database Required**: Demonstrates persistence concepts without complex setup
- **In-Memory Operations**: Shows CRUD operations in action
- **Real-time Updates**: Inventory changes are immediately visible
